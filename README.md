# Egonet-Visualizer

Draws graphs of network datasets using the D3.js library.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is the product of an internship I did under Professor Aaron Clauset and graduate student Anna Broido (both from the University of Colorado, Boulder) in the fall of 2017.  

Their research focuses in part on network data sets.  My responsibility was to create a tool that allowed researchers to open and explore network datasets visually by displaying the egonet of a particular node in the graph.  The tool has capability for weighted graphs and directed graphs, as well as a few more options for displaying the network.  

This was developed with the D3.js library.  This is an example of a force-directed diagram, which D3 does very well.  I enjoyed working with D3 quite a bit, and would gladly do so again for another project.  For more information about D3, visit d3js.org.

Many of the datasets included are well known networks that are used for many projects related to network research.  However, the L2K Class Network is one that I created myself when working on this project.  The nodes in this dataset are classmates of mine in the 7th period section of Legacy 2000 (a STEM program offered by my high school) in the fall of 2017.  Each student has their full schedule attached, with the exception of 7th period, which for all students is the L2K class.  Edges in this graph represent that the two students share a class together, and the weight of that edge is how many classes they share.  Some students do not share a class together and some students spend almost the whole day together.  This kind of dataset would be useful for answering several research questions about these students, such as: 

1.  Population statistics: Ex. How many L2K students also take Calculus 2? What about Claculus 2 and AP Literature?
2.  Edge-based statistics: Ex. Which students share the most classes?  Which share the least? What kind of distribution does class           sharing follow among L2K students? If we had data on non-L2K students, we could ask do L2K students share more classes between each     other than non-L2K students? If so, then what does this say about the kind of community this program fosters?
3.  Problem solving: Ex. Student A has Student B's flash drive.  To whom should Student A give the flash drive in 1st period to get the     flash drive to Student B by 7th period using the least number of students?

From this project I learned a lot about time management, as well as greatly built upon my understandings of computer science research. Aaron, Anna and I met biweekly to monitor progress and answer questions about features implemented.  Other than that, I took it upon myself to distribute my work evenly throughout the semester.  I dedicated an hour of my class schedule everyday to work on this, and kept a detailed hour log to help quantify my involvement.  Overall, this project totaled 50 hours and 4 minutes.

As far as my learning of computer science research, this project really got me excited to ask questions about my data, and create a product that allowed me to answer those questions.  While modern computer science research I had been exposed to before centered around machine learning, this project showed me that computer science can be applied to many different areas of research (ex. sociology in the case of my L2K class dataset).  Overall, what I valued most out of this experience is the knowledge I gained of the scientific process and how to ask good questions.
